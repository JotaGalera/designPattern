# Factory Method

### What is?:

Factory pattern is a design pattern wich solves the problem of creating different objects with the same context.

### Example:

Usually, in a videogame, you can select between different difficulties. In this case, we only use two kind: Easy and Hard. The number of enemies and other obstacles are different according to the difficulty. If we make two map implementations and we do a mix between easy and hard mode in our Main. We get a big mountain of spaghetti code. For this reason, we use Factory pattern.
